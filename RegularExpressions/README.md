This file was generated in Microsoft Word from Microsoft 365 using the `rand` text generator by typing `=rand(10,6)` into a blank document and pressing `Enter`.

At the end of 6 of the paragraphs a random sentence relating to regular expressions has been added that has now contextual relationship to the rest of the text.
